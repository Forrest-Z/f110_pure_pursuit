# f110_pure_pursuit
Repository for pure pursuit tracking algorithm for f110 autonomous car

An Implementation of pure pursuit tracking algorithm for f110 autonomous car proposed by the Robotics Institute, CMU.

This ROS node runs the pure pursuit algorithm that provides the tracking of robot given path and localization information (Pose).

To test in a simulated environment, the racecar simulator can be cloned from [mLab's racecar_simulator repository](https://github.com/mlab-upenn/racecar_simulator) and the icp scan mathcing node can be launched using rosrun.
